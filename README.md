# FlashcardApp

# Overview

FlashcardApp is an interactive flashcard study application designed to help users enhance their learning experience. The application allows users to create decks of flashcards, review them, and test their knowledge. The key features of the application are:

- **Deck Management**: Users can create decks of flashcards, with each deck having a specific topic or category. Users can add flashcards to or remove them from these decks.

- **Flashcards**: Each flashcard has a front side, which usually contains a question or a prompt, and a back side, which contains the answer or explanation. Additionally, each flashcard has a review date that the application uses to schedule review sessions.

- **Testing Mode**: By clicking the “Start Test” button, users can start a test session where they will be shown the front of each flashcard in the deck in sequence. Users have to type what they think is on the back of the card. After the user submits their answer by clicking “Submit Answer,” the next flashcard is presented. At the end of the test session, the application displays the test results, including a list of flashcards the user answered correctly and another list of those answered incorrectly.

- **Review Mode**: The “Start Review” button initiates a review session for flashcards whose review date has passed. In this mode, flashcards are presented to users one at a time. Users have the option to either type what they think is on the back of the card or click on “Show Answer” to see the back of the card. Regardless of the choice, users are prompted to self-assess their familiarity with the flashcard. This assessment is taken into account by an algorithm that calculates the next review date for that flashcard.

- **Statistics**: Users can track their learning progress and application usage through statistical data. This includes the total minutes spent using the app, total test sessions count, total review sessions count, and total card reviews count. The application also provides visualizations of daily statistics for the current month.

This application aims to offer a personalized and effective way for users to study various subjects through spaced repetition and self-assessment.
